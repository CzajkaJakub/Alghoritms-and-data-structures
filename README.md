# Alghoritms-and-data-structures
Projects which was made for alghoritms and data structures at university. 

- Sorting alghoritms - Project, which was made to examine differences between popular sorting alghoritms like amount of 
  swaps and comparisons with some types of input data(sorting times)
    - Shell Sort (Knuth) with BubbleSort
    - Quick Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Heap Sort 
    
- Graphs alghoritms with fallbacks - The main goal of this project, was check that input graph has Hamiltonian cycle in undirected graph (by graph matrix)
and in directed graph(list of consequents) and Eulerian cycle (on the same types of graphs and matrixes)
  
- Graphs alghoritms - SProject, main goal of this, was implementation a grapfs which are typed in 2 types of matrixes and sort it topologicly:
- adjective matrix and graph matrix - in the first one one's means there is connection between pair (num of column, num of poem) of vertices, in the secound one matrix is typed by special alghoritm.
The program is checking a cycle of graph, if it exist, there is unable to topological sort. There are 2 types of sort
  which are unable to take 2 types of graphs:
  - Kahn alghoritm
    - DFS alghoritm
    
- Data structures - Project, which was made to examine a some types of data structures like bst and avl trees.
Main tasks which had to be implemented:
    -find and type a ways to the biggest and smallest value in the tree
    -delete an element in the tree by type a key
    -type all elements of tree (in-order/pre-order and past-order with deleting elements)
    -type a sub-tree from the element which is a input key
    -balancing a tree

- Backpack problem  - Project, which was made to examine a popular problem of backpack.
Alghoritms which were used to solve this problem 
- Brute force alghoritm - Very slow which checks every possibility of backpack
- Greedy Algorithm - the fastest of this three but there is a hight possibility to get options which is not the best
- Dynamic Programming Alghoritm - balanced alghoritm which give the best option. It is operationg on matrix
