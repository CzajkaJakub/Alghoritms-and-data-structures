# Algorithms-and-data-structures
## Projects which was made for algorithms and data structures subject at university. 

### ***1.Sorting algorithms*** 
Project, which was made to examine differences between popular sorting algorithms like amount of 
swaps, comparisons and sorting times with some types of generated data input.
- Shell Sort (with Knuth increments), numbers are sorted by BubbleSort.
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort 
    
### ***2.Graphs algorithms with fallbacks*** 
The main goal of this project, was checked that input graph has Hamiltonian cycle in undirected graph (graph stored in graph matrix)
and in directed graph(list of consequent) and Eulerian cycle (graph stored in the same types, graph matrix and list of consequent).
  

### ***3.Graphs algorithms***  
Main goal of this project, was implementation a graphs which are stored in 2 types of matrixes and sort it topologically.
At point of start, program checks a cycle of graph, if it exist, there is unable to topological sort, because you can move through graph indefinitely.

#### Sorting graph take place by 2 types of sorting algorithms:

- Kahn algorithm
- DFS algorithm

### Adjective matrix
Data stored in this matrix, has a connections between pairs of vertices. For example if in directed graph V1 has connection to V2,
in their places in matrix is typed (1 - in) and (-1 - out) from vertices.
    
### Graph matrix 
Data in this type of matrix is saved by special algorithm.

    
### ***4.Data structures***
Project, which was made to examine types of data structures:

- bst tree
- avl tree.

Tasks which had to be implemented:
- find and type ways to the biggest and smallest value in the tree.
- delete an element in the tree by type a key.
- type all elements of tree (in-order/pre-order and past-order with deleting elements).
- type a sub-tree from the element which is input key.
- balancing a tree.

### ***5.Backpack problem***   
Project, which was made to examine a popular problem of backpack.
Algorithms which were used to solve this problem:
- **Brute force algorithm** - Very slow which checks every possibility of backpack, but we have assurance that the output data is the best option.
- **Greedy Algorithm** - Very fast but there is a high possibility to get options which is not the best, (we stop at point if we can't put next item into a backpack).
- **Dynamic Programming Alghoritm** - Balanced algorithm which is fast and gives the best option. It is operating on matrix.
