###***5.Backpack problem***   
Project, which was made to examine a popular problem of backpack.
Algorithms which were used to solve this problem:
- **Brute force algorithm** - Very slow which checks every possibility of backpack, but we have assurance that the output data is the best option.
- **Greedy Algorithm** - Very fast but there is a high possibility to get options which is not the best, (we stop at point if we can't put next item into a backpack).
- **Dynamic Programming Alghoritm** - Balanced algorithm which is fast and gives the best option. It is operating on matrix.
