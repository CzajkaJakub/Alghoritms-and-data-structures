School project, main goal of this, was implementation a grapfs which are typed in 2 types of matrixes and sort it topologicly:
- adjective matrix and graph matrix - in the first one one's means there is connection between pair (num of column, num of poem) of vertices, in the secound one matrix is typed by special alghoritm.
The program is checking a cycle of graph, if it exist, there is unable to topological sort. There are 2 types of sort
  which are unable to take 2 types of graphs:
  - Kahn alghoritm
    - DFS alghoritm
