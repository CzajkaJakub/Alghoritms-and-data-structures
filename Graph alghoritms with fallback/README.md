### ***2.Graphs algorithms with fallbacks*** 
The main goal of this project, was checked that input graph has Hamiltonian cycle in undirected graph (graph stored in graph matrix)
and in directed graph(list of consequent) and Eulerian cycle (graph stored in the same types, graph matrix and list of consequent).
